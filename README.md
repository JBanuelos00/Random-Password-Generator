# Random-Password-Generator
An interface that will randomly generate a password with options and length designated by a user

## User Story

//Fictionalized for the sake of the assignment!

I cannot tell you how many accounts I have accross emails, forum logins, game logins, work logins, etc... Each and every one with a request for its own "unique" password that I usually have to come up with on the spot. That's when the idea to create my own password generating application came to mind. It would make generating a strong, unique password easy, especially with the copy to clipboard functionality! 

## Business Context

For companies that handle large amounts of sensitive data, weak passwords can pose a real security threat. An application that can generate strong passwords quickly and effortlessly saves employees time and ensures secure access to data.

## Acceptance Criteria

We have included several parameters to allow the creation of a strong password.

First is the slider bar which allows a user to select between an 8 and a 128 long digit password. Length alone, however is not sufficient.

Complexity is key, which is why we've included the option to allow lower and upper case letters, numbers, and symbols for your password.

PLEASE NOTE: At least one option must be selected or else no password will be generated.

It is recommended to include as many variables as possible.

Once your password length and complexity has been selected, clicking "Generate Password," will post your randomly generated key in the text box provided.

The "Copy to Clipboard" button will allow you to easily copy to your computer's clipboard for use on another site/form.
